**Data Cleaning Using Machine Learning**
**Overview**
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to automate and enhance the process of data cleaning. Data cleaning is a crucial step in data preparation, as it ensures the quality and reliability of the data used for analysis and modeling. This repository includes code, models, and examples demonstrating how machine learning can be used to identify and correct errors, handle missing values, and detect outliers in datasets.

Features
**Missing Data Imputation:**
Automatically fill in missing values using machine learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and regression techniques.
Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers using algorithms like Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, and clustering methods.
Data Consistency: Ensure data consistency by detecting and correcting inconsistencies in categorical and numerical data.
Noise Removal: Filter out noise from datasets using feature engineering and dimensionality reduction techniques.
**Data Transformation:**
Apply transformations such as normalization, standardization, and encoding to prepare data for analysis.
**Data Sources**
The project utilizes various open datasets for demonstration purposes. Some of these include:

UCI Machine Learning Repository: A collection of datasets for benchmarking machine learning models.
Kaggle Datasets: Popular datasets from Kaggle competitions and challenges.
How It Works
**Data Preprocessing:**
Load and preprocess the raw data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
**Model Training: **
Train machine learning models to identify and correct data issues. Different models are used for specific tasks such as missing data imputation, outlier detection, and noise removal.
**Model Evaluation:**
Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure the effectiveness of the cleaning process.
**Data Cleaning: **
Apply the trained models to clean the dataset, improving its quality for further analysis or modeling.
Validation: Validate the cleaned data by comparing it with a benchmark dataset or by checking its performance in subsequent analysis or machine learning tasks.
